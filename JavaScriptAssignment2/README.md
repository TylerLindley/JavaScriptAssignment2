# My Application will be a website similar to Kijiji/Craigslist, users will be able to place items that they do not want anymore and can sell for a specific price.
# (CRUD Implementation) Users will be able to add items, edit/delete their own (via authentication)
# Not signed in users/not the listers, will be able to read other peoples advertisements
