# JavaScriptAssignment2

My assignment will be based on option A. I will be making a website that has the ability to list items for sale. 
Users will be able to use the CRUD implantation to add items on to the website and save it.
If they are logged in they will be able to edit theirs, or delete the listing if they have sold it. 
I will use authentication to ensure that the user is the owner of the listing to edit and delete. 
Otherwise, they will only be able to read other peoples listings.

Using the CSS Frameworks from https://getbootstrap.com/ and https://bootswatch.com and I made some myself aswell.
